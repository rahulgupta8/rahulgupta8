- Allows for Schema Evolution
- Partition management
- Time travel and rollback
- Data Compaction
- Binary format

## Engine

> Always need a engine to work with Iceberg table, can't simply just open the file.

- Spark is the recommended engine from Iceberg
- Snowflake is a working partner

## Core Concept - Catalogs

This enables all the cool iceberg stuff

- Glue catalog
- Apache Polaris Open Catalog

### How does the Catalog work

- Tracks all the changes in the metadata of iceberg

## Code example

Snowflake Code

```snow +exec

select date as product_date,
product_line as line from CORTEX_ANALYST_DEMO.REVENUE_TIMESERIES.DAILY_REVENUE_BY_PRODUCT
limit 10;
```
